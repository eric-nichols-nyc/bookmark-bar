Fast.**

Your crawlers will appear human-like and fly under the radar of modern bot protections even with the default configuration. Crawlee gives you the tools to crawl the web for links, scrape data, and store it to disk or cloud while staying configurable to suit your project's needs.

Crawlee is available as the [`crawlee`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crawlee) NPM package.

`crawlee`ðŸ‘‰ **View full documentation, guides and examples on the [Crawlee project website](https://crawlee.dev)** ðŸ‘ˆ

Installation
------------

We recommend visiting the [Introduction tutorial](https://crawlee.dev/docs/introduction) in Crawlee documentation for more information.

Crawlee requires **Node.js 16 or higher**.

### With Crawlee CLI

The fastest way to try Crawlee out is to use the **Crawlee CLI** and choose the **Getting started example**. The CLI will install all the necessary dependencies and add boilerplate code for you to play with.

### Manual installation

If you prefer adding Crawlee **into your own project**, try the example below. Because it uses `PlaywrightCrawler` we also need to install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). It's not bundled with Crawlee to reduce install size.

`PlaywrightCrawler`By default, Crawlee stores data to `./storage` in the current working directory. You can override this directory via Crawlee configuration. For details, see [Configuration guide](https://crawlee.dev/docs/guides/configuration), [Request storage](https://crawlee.dev/docs/guides/request-storage) and [Result storage](https://crawlee.dev/docs/guides/result-storage).
